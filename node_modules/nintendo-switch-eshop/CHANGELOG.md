## [2.1.1] - 2019-02-26
### Fixes
- Moved `@types/country-data` to devDependencies thinking that would be okay but apparently it is not as it breaks TypeScript builds. So sorry! This should fix these kind of errors that were present in v2.1.0:

## [2.1.0] - 2019-02-26
### Fixes
- Get rid of Gulp for development environment => NPM Scripts suffice just fine
- Move `@types` to devDependencies where they belong => No more installed along with the package
- Change to terser-folder => Better ES6 support
- Fixed looping in `getGamesAmerica` => The lib loops for you again now, sorry for breaking that!
- Fixed looping in `getPrices` => Related to the other looping issue, now fixed again!

### Added
- Expose `GameUS`, `GameEU` and `GameJP` interface for TypeScript users
